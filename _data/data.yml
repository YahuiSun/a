    summary: | # Yahui: | makes sure the content below can be multiple lines and paragraphs

      Motivated by China's first crewed space mission in 2003, I studied aerospace engineering 
      for my bachelor and master degrees in the Harbin Institute of Technology, 
      which is the leading university in this area in China.  Subsequently, I studied Steiner tree problems in graphs for my PhD in the University of Melbourne. 
      My current research interests originated from this study. At present, I'm a research fellow in the School of Computer Science and Engineering
      at the Nanyang Technological University, 
      wishing to find a tenure position in the next few years.
