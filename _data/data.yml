    summary: | # Yahui: | makes sure the content below can be multiple lines and paragraphs

      Motivated by China's first crewed space mission in 2003, I studied aeraspace engineering in the Harbin Institute of Technology, 
      which is the leading university in this area in China, for my bachelor and master degrees. 
      However, even though I have been awarded several First-level Scholarships and a National Scholarship in Harbin,
      I slowly realized that I may not be suitable or gifted 
      enough for contributing to China's great space endeavour. 
      
      
      As a result, I changed my research interests to graph analytics and graph mining in the University of Melbourne, 
      where I studied the Steiner tree problems in graphs for my PhD 
      (with the full scholarships awarded by the University of Melbourne). 
      I do quite enjoy the graph researches. 
      
      Currently, I'm a research fellow in the School of Computer Science and Engineering
      at the Nanyang Technological University, 
      wishing to find a tenure position in the next few years (I'm a bit paranoid on this). I have written some papers, 
      but only few are published at very decent places, such as IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking. 
      I'm now trying to increase the number of such publications.
